# canvas-support-menu
This script adds extra icons/functions to the end of the global navigation window.
It is intended to be used by support staff to 
- quickly open the corresponding beta and test sites
- copy the breadcrumb details to be used to add to service desk tickets.
- to access our online customer management system (so this one is very specific to me.)

To use, 
1.) Install TamperMonkey (https://www.tampermonkey.net/) using your preferred browser.
2.) Then go to the canvas-support-menu page.
3.) TamperMonkey will detect that you are trying to install this script and open an information panel. 
4.) Click “Install” to proceed.
5.) In TamperMonkey for this script, update "Settings" tab -> "User includes" to include the domain name of your Canvas site.
